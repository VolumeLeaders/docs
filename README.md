# VolumeLeaders Starter Kit

## Introduction

### What is Volume Leaders

Volume Leaders is a cloud‑based analytics platform that processes millions of time & sales data points every trading day to surface the largest, market‑moving institutional trades on U.S. exchanges. By ingesting every reported print and enriching it with contextual metrics—historical percentile rank, average trade size, trade conditions, and much, much more—VL delivers insights you simply can’t get from raw exchange feeds or other platforms that claim to be "monitoring dark pools" or "looking for unusual trades".

### Key Benefits and Use-Cases

- **Front‑Run Major Price Moves**\
  Spot large block trades and dark‑pool prints before a full market reaction—so you can establish positions ahead of the broader crowd.
- **Validate Technical Setups with Hard Data**\
  Rather than relying on chart patterns alone, confirm breakouts, breakdowns or reversal signals by seeing whether real institutions are positioned at key price levels.
- **Optimize Trading Strategies & Sharpen Risk Management**\
  Align your trades with the knowledge of where institutions are participating to improve your win rate, capture cleaner risk‑reward setups and to protect capital when you find yourself on the wrong side of institutional positioning.
- **Build & Backtest Quant Models**\
  Download enriched time‑and‑sales metadata for thousands of securities—ideal for machine‑learning pipelines or statistical analysis. If you are business with more frequent & real-time needs, inquire about our robust suite of APIs.
- **Monitor Sector Rotation**\
  See which sectors and industries are garnering unusual institutional interest—helping you rotate into hot sectors (or dodge weak ones) before the broader indexes catch up.
- **Event‑Driven Edge**\
  Whether it's news, earnings, Fed announcements, or geopolitical shocks, you're likely to see institutional positioning before the headlines print. Monitor institutional reallocations and give yourself a data‑driven head start on volatility trades.
- **Automate Your Workflow**\
  Configure ultra‑granular, webhook‑ready alerts on any trade—so your systems (or your phone) can instantly ping you when a large buyer or seller shows up in your universe.
